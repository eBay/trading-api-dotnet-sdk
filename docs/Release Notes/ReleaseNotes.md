Release Information for the eBay SDK for .NET
=============================================

**Important:** Changes to the Trading API affect the SDK. For example, in schema version latest, deprecated objects in the schema were deleted, creating backward incompatibility. Please see the [Trading API Release Notes](http://developer.ebay.com/DevZone/XML/docs/ReleaseNotes.html) for ongoing updates to the schema (including occasional removals of schema elements). Please also see [Versioning Strategy](http://developer.ebay.com/DevZone/XML/docs/HowTo/eBayWS/eBaySchemaVersioning.html) and [Deprecated Objects](http://developer.ebay.com/DevZone/XML/docs/Reference/ebay/deprObjects.html).

[SDK Version latest .NET Release](#latest)

SDK Version Latest Release
--------------------------

With Latest release, the .NET Trading API SDK supports OAuth for authentication. eBay uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol only for authorizing the eBay Buy and Sell RESTful APIs. Now, OAuth can be used with the Trading API, as well. With the Trading API, all calls use the authorization code grant type, meaning users must go through the sign-in flow to grant permission to the application to make calls on their behalf. Please refer to the [Handling Authorization in Your Applications](http://developer.ebay.com/DevZone/javasdk-jaxb/docs/GettingStarted/GettingStarted.html#AuthAndAuth) section in the SDK Getting Started topic for more information.

**Using OAuth with the SDK**

eBay uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authorizing the eBay Buy and Sell RESTful APIs. eBay’s OAuth implementation can also be used with the Trading API. With the Trading API, all calls use the authorization code grant type, meaning users must go through the sign-in flow to grant permission to the application to make calls on their behalf. For details about using authorization code grant type to retrieve access tokens, see [Getting User Tokens](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/oauth-user-token.html) in the Using eBay RESTful APIs guide. For the Trading API, we recommend that you use the https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api\_scope/sell.account scope.

When you are able to retrieve oauth user access tokens, you simply pass your oauth token to the ApiContext object and the SDK does the rest.  
  
**New ConsoleGetItemUsingOAuth using OAuth User Access Token**

ConsoleGetItemUsingOAuth sample has been added illustrating the usage of OAuth User Access Token instead of Auth&Auth Token to access eBay Trading API Server as below

*   ApiContext apiContext = new ApiContext();  
    
*   ApiCredential cred = apiContext.getApiCredential();  
    
*   cred.oAuthToken = "YouroAuthToken";  
    

  
Important: eBay will be adding scopes for use with the Trading API specifically. When new scopes are available, your application must be ready to implement them. Users will be required to sign-in and go through the permission grant flow when the new scopes are implemented. This release is compatible with eBay's latest Trading WSDL.

  

Please refer to the [Trading API Release Notes](https://developer.ebay.com/Devzone/XML/docs/ReleaseNotes.html) for a detailed list of the new elements and features.
