	/// This class enables specification of time values for DateTime fields.
	/// Information and tips about DateTime objects are available in the MSDN library. 
	/// This class contains properties for both local and GMT (UTC) time.
	/// If you use such properties of this class interchangably, the last property that is set overwrites the previous one.
	/// Note that if only the properties for local time are used, then the following can occur with an application: A local time (for example, 10 a.m.) is emitted by an application, and the API changes that time to GMT (for example, to 5 p.m.). And a GMT time from the API (for example, 1 p.m.) received by an application is converted to local time (for example, to 6 a.m.).
