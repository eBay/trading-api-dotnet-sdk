		/// <param name="IncludeWatchCount">
		/// The seller can include this field and set its value to <code>true</code> if that seller wants to see how many prospective bidders/buyers currently have the item added to their Watch Lists. The Watch count is returned in the <b>WatchCount</b> field in the response.

		/// <param name="IncludeItemSpecifics">
		/// If this field is included and set to <code>true</code>, the call response includes the <b>ItemSpecifics</b> container
		/// if Item Specifics are defined for the listing.
		/// 
		/// An Item Specific is any aspect that helps define/classify the item. Many eBay categories mandate including specific Item Specifics, so it is always a good idea to make a call to <b>GetCategorySpecifics</b> to see what Item Specifics are required and which ones are recommended.
		/// 
		/// Including this field and setting it to <code>true</code> will also return the <strong>UnitInfo</strong> container if applicable. The <strong>UnitInfo</strong> container will provide information about the weight, volume or other quantity measurement of a listed item. The European Union requires listings for certain types of products to include the price per unit so buyers can accurately compare prices. eBay uses the <strong>UnitType</strong> and <strong>UnitQuantity</strong> values and the item's listed price to calculate and display the per-unit price on eBay EU sites.
		/// </param>

		/// <param name="IncludeTaxTable">
		/// The seller will include this field and set its value to <code>true</code> if the seller wishes to view the defined sales tax rates for the various jurisdictions in the country (generally, states and provinces).

		/// <br/><br/>
		/// Even if this field is included and set to <code>true</code>, no <b>TaxTable</b> container will be returned If no sales tax rates are defined for any tax jurisdiction in the seller's sales tax table.

		/// Sales tax tables are only available for eBay US and Canada marketplaces. Sales tax rates can be added/modified in My eBay, through the <b>SetTaxTable</b> and <b>GetTaxTable</b> calls of the Trading API, or through the Sales Tax calls of the Account API.
